How I can perform that in a simple way? I can set width to 25 %, but I didnt find out how to paste a \"nested block\" at the last position.\nb) Whats do you suggest as a boilerplate theme?\n- A light Full Site Editor like Twenty-Four and use the Navigation Elements from MaxiBlocks in the Header Section of the theme:\nor\n- A non FSE Theme with own header-builder like Blocksy and use their Header Builder?\nI'm not yet a fan of the FSE, so I tent to the second one. But I'm bit concerned about the additional bloat.\nc) In terms of business consistency:\n- Will the Maxiblock Plugin also work without access to the library to your server? Is a kind of local storage of blocks planned?\nd) Most maxiblocks exists in dark or light mode. Any plan to add a dark mode switcher? What I found out is, that its not compatible with the Greenshift Dark Mode Switcher.",

Site can hosted by any hosting service? Don‚Äôt need to be on your hosting?\nAll websites created would need ability to view first image then have carousel effect. (Packaged images need to show few samples before purchased off site for visual of the random designs.)\n5. Is this possible without crazy load of work by designer?\n6.
