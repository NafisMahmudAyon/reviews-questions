I still have some static landing pages, but if you have a lot of content, POSTX does the hard work for you. I had refunded it before, but I did not have , or I thought I did not have a use case.

I'm currently using the free theme without any other design plugins. It's straightforward and user-friendly; all you have to do is select a design and save it. Having had a positive experience with postX, I decided to purchase their other tools as well.

    "Review": "Let me start by saying, I rarely write reviews. But when a product like PostX comes along, it demands to be praised. I‚Äôve been using their service prior to their AppSumo campaign, and when I saw them featured there, I didn‚Äôt hesitate to go all-in.\n\nWhy, you ask?\n\nSimply put, PostX is a massive time-saver. With just a few clicks, you can create a stunning, professionally-designed, and optimized blog or content website. The themes are stylish, minimalist, and modern.\n\nI remember the days when I had to spend weeks tweaking the Generatepress theme to make it work well for my content site. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the number of additional plugins I had to install! But with PostX, those days are long gone.\n\nI know what you might be thinking: ‚ÄúWhat about Elementor?‚Äù\n\nYes, I‚Äôm very familiar with Elementor, but content websites need to be optimized for speed. Elementor can be overwhelming and can significantly slow down your site if you aren‚Äôt careful. And honestly, who has the time these days to build a website block by block?\n\nI‚Äôve built dozens of websites with various themes and editors. So trust me when I say, PostX is different. I‚Äôve measured my website‚Äôs speed score with both Elementor and PostX, and the latter came out on top.\n\nThe support from the PostX team has been top-notch.\n\nThey‚Äôve helped me several times, always in a professional manner. What‚Äôs even more amazing is that they‚Äôre a team of developers from Bangladesh. It‚Äôs wonderful to see talent from my home country shining on a global stage, especially on platforms like AppSumo. Thanks to other Bangladeshi developers on Appsumo: Academy LMS, REOON, and Dark My Site.\n\nDespite numerous barriers such as English not being our primary language, lack of international payment gateways, and minimal support from local administration, our developers are providing top-tier services on an international scale.\n\nTo sum up, if you‚Äôre involved in SEO or content marketing and want to create an outstanding blog website, PostX is a must-have.\n\nAnd the best part?\n\nYou don‚Äôt even need a paid theme - a simple free Generatepress or Hello theme works perfectly fine with PostX. That‚Äôs another plus in my book for cost-saving!\n\nTrust me, I‚Äôve been in your shoes before. PostX is truly a game-changer.\n\nRead less",

This dynamic site builder for WordPress is a game-changer, especially for news, magazine, and blog site creators.\n\nThe Gutenberg blocks, with their diverse design variations, make post display a breeze - a testament to the thoughtfulness that went into creating this tool. The addition of 300+ patterns in the Starter Packs is a boon, offering a jump-start to site creation.\n\nWhat truly stands out is the Dynamic Site Builder. It‚Äôs a time-saver, assisting in creating all essential pages effortlessly.\n\nThe seamless integration with Elementor and SEO plugins like Yoast and Rank Math showcases the versatile nature of PostX. The Query Builder is another impressive feature, allowing flexible post display based on categories, tags or user engagements.\n\nThe typography control and custom font uploading option add to the user-friendly nature of PostX, providing customization that matches your website‚Äôs style. The addition of dynamic sliders and carousels further enhances the aesthetic appeal.\n\nMy appreciation extends to the responsive and helpful support team. They are proactive and quick to assist, making the overall experience even better.\n\nIn conclusion, based on my user experience, I wholeheartedly recommend PostX. It‚Äôs not just a product, it‚Äôs a comprehensive solution for site-building. Don‚Äôt just take my word for it, give PostX a try and see the difference yourself!\n\nRead less",

Its versatility and efficiency are incomparable.\n\nUnparalleled Flexibility:\nPostX offers an extensive range of customization options for News blog layouts. Whether you prefer a grid, list, or slider layout, the plugin caters to all. You can easily modify column sizes, content elements, typography, and colours according to your needs.\n\nUser-Friendly Interface:\nThe user interface is intuitive and straightforward. Regardless of your technical expertise level with WordPress, you will find it easy to use. The drag-and-drop feature particularly enhances the experience for those less technically inclined.\n\nEfficient Performance:\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of PostX is its smooth performance. It does not slow down your website despite offering rich features and functionalities.\n\nExcellent Support Team:\nThe support team deserves recognition as well.

I have explored every option out there for maximizing the potential of Gutenberg and when it comes to crafting gorgeous layouts and my favorite and highlight of the tool Single Posts, nothing compares to PostX. You can tell the care and time that has been put into developing this so it should be an instant buy for anyone who is dedicated to using Gutenberg. Thank you PostX Team!\n\nRead less",

    "Review": "I am using Kadence theme and the post loop blocks they offer are good but I have a hard time getting them to look how I want them. This plugin made it super easy to get posts to look exactly how I want. There are a ton of options and I can customize just about every detail. The starter packs look really good and make it easy to just import a whole page that is nicely designed in seconds.",

    "Review": "I used many different page builder WPBakery, Stackable, etc... and most recently Greenshift. But when I have postX, everything is like plug/play with easy customization vs using builder to build out individual block which is so time consuming. The drawback for Free version was limited blocks and starters etc...I love the query function as well. Recently, I read you now have AI integration also which is super awesome!\n\nRecommended for any bloggers that use Gutenberg and speed is not impacted at all.\n\nRead less",
